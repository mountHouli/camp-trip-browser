## Miscellaneous Notes

Used node v9.8.0 while developing.

npm script "lint" explicity specifies exit status 0 because eslint produces exit status 1 when it finds lint errors and the npm script runner detects this and reports that the command had an error.

## To-Do

- In server.js, require() paths are relative to where things sit in the dist directory, so make them work for env=dev as well
- Build system
  - eslint
    - remove .eslintignore
    - make it run on files in the root dir
    - no-console rule (maybe remove it altogether)
    - .eslintrc.json React recommended settings
  - Setup dev envr
    - Hot reloading
    - watch original sources, not dist/ files
    - debug original sources, not dist/ files
    - Remove "devtool" parameter from production webpack configs.
  - Minify
  - clean dist/ dir
  - Could use code splitting to make browserBundle.js and ssrBundle.js share most of the same code.  Not necessar, however, because code splitting is usually for performance reasons.
  - npm uninstall webpack-dev-server

## Done

- Build system
  - Setup SSR for prod env
  - delete client/server/shared folder structure

## How environmentt and build system works

### When making a request to the production SSR server

- The node server (dist/server.js) handles all GET requests (requests to ANY path).
- It uses dist/ssrBundle.js (created by webpack.config.ssrBundle.js) to render the react for the requested page (react-router chooses what to render based on the URL path) and plug it into html generated from a template, which it then returns to the client.
- When that html reaches the browser, it has element `<script src="/public/browserBundle.js"></script>` which makes the browser grab dist/public/browserBundle.js (which is generated by webpack.config.browserBundle.js; also which dist/server.js's express.static() is configured to return), which--upon getting to the browser--runs and calls ReactDOM.hydrate to hydrate the existing HTML that was originally put there by ssrBundle.js

!! remove .eslintignore
